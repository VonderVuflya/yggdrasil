"""Retrieval-quality eval for the Yggdrasil engine (NOT a code unit test).

Measures how good the memory ENGINE is at retrieving the right memory for a
query — the behavioural metric we optimise. Seeds a fixed, realistic corpus
into an in-process MemoryStore (temp DB, deterministic, no network) and scores
a labelled set of queries with recall@1, recall@3 and MRR, broken down by
query class:

  - keyword     : query shares words with the target (lexical should handle)
  - identifier  : target uses code identifiers (scrollWidth, useEffect) the
                  query spells as separate words (motivates identifier split)
  - paraphrase  : query shares MEANING but few/no words (motivates dense search)

Run:  python3 eval/ygg_eval.py
Exit code is 0 always; this is a measurement, not a pass/fail gate.
