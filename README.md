Every new chat, your AI forgets. You re-explain the project, the decisions, the gotchas — every time, in every tool. **Yggdrasil is a tiny always-on memory brain that any agent plugs into.** Open a new session, in any project, with any AI, and it already knows what you decided, what broke, and what's still open — and it keeps learning in the background.

```text
$ cd ~/projects/checkout-api && claude        # a brand-new session

🌳 Yggdrasil  (injected automatically at session start)
   Open follow-ups & status:
   • [project_status] payments refactor: idempotency keys added; open: e2e tests
   Durable memory for `checkout-api`:
   • [debugging_lesson] webhook 401 → signing secret rotated; update env + redeploy

> "have I solved a flaky websocket reconnect anywhere before?"

🌳 recall → found in project `realtime-dash`:
   refresh the token *before* opening the socket, then retry with capped backoff.
```

No "let me remind you what we did yesterday." It's just there.

## Why

**Without Yggdrasil** you re-explain context in every new chat, lessons from one project never reach the next, switching Claude Code → Codex starts from zero, and hard-won debugging insights die with the session.

**With Yggdrasil:**

- 🧠 **Persistent memory** — decisions, lessons, and status survive across sessions.
- 🔌 **Any agent, one brain** — Claude Code, Codex, any MCP host share the same memory.
- 🌐 **Cross-project recall** — *"this looks like what you did in project B — reuse it?"*
- 🌱 **Self-learning** — a local model consolidates memory in the background (zero API tokens).
- 🪪 **A soul** — give it a name and personality; it shows up the same in every tool.
- 🔒 **100% local & private** — your memory lives on your machine. No cloud, no account.

## 🚀 Install

> **Requirements:** macOS (Linux/Windows soon), Python 3.10+ — or let `uv`/`npx` fetch Python for you. Semantic search is optional and uses a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model.

```bash
uvx --from yggdrasil-memory ygg install      # recommended
```

<details>
<summary>Prefer npm, pipx, pip, Homebrew, or source? (same engine)</summary>

| Tool | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **npm / npx** | `npx yggdrasil-memory install` |
| **pipx** | `pipx install yggdrasil-memory && ygg install` |
| **pip** | `pip install yggdrasil-memory && ygg install` |
| **Homebrew** _(macOS)_ | `brew install VonderVuflya/tap/yggdrasil && ygg install` |
| **from source** | `uvx --from git+https://github.com/VonderVuflya/yggdrasil.git ygg install` |

</details>

`ygg install` is a one-time guided setup: it detects your hardware and **recommends a local model that fits** (or pick `none` for a zero-config, lexical-only setup), generates a private auth token, installs an **always-on background service**, and **registers the tools with Claude Code and Codex**. Check it any time with `ygg doctor`; upgrade with `ygg update`.

Just want to kick the tyres without installing a service? `uvx --from yggdrasil-memory ygg serve --reset --db /tmp/ygg.sqlite`.

## 🧠 How it works

Yggdrasil is **memory + tools** — the *intelligence* is your LLM. It just makes sure the right memory is in front of the right agent at the right moment.

```

- **Engine** — a stdlib-only HTTP server over SQLite + FTS5. Zero dependencies, ~21 MB RAM.
- **Retrieval** — lexical by default; add a local embedding model for semantic + cross-lingual search. Frequently-recalled and pinned memories rank higher.
- **Governance** — duplicates / conflicts are surfaced for review; changes are non-destructive (archive, never delete).
- **Obsidian** — every memory is also a Markdown note you can read and edit.

## 🆚 Yggdrasil vs the rest

context-mode and Context7 own **different layers** (your live context window; fresh library docs). **mem0** is the closest — it's also a memory layer, but a different *kind*: an SDK/platform for **AI apps to remember their users**. Yggdrasil is **install-and-go, local-first memory of _your own_ work for the coding agents you already use** — no code, no cloud, no API key.

| | **Yggdrasil** | [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) | [context-mode](https://github.com/mksglu/context-mode) | [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Durable memory of **your own work** (decisions, lessons, status) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ in-session | ❌ |
| **Drop-in** for your agents, *no code* (install + MCP) | ✅ | ⚠️ *SDK / integration* | ✅ | ✅ |
| Works with **no LLM & no API key** (zero-dep, lexical default) | ✅ | ❌ *needs an LLM* | ✅ | ❌ |
| **100% local & private** (no cloud by default) | ✅ | ⚠️ *cloud default* | ✅ | ☁️ hosted |
| Cross-**project** recall ("solved this in project B") | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | — |
| One memory shared **across tools** (Claude Code · Codex · any MCP host) | ✅ | ⚠️ *per-app* | ✅ | ✅ |
| Keeps the **live context window** lean | — | — | ✅ | ❌ |
| Up-to-date public **library docs** | ❌ *(use Context7)* | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

> **mem0 vs Yggdrasil, in one line:** mem0 is a memory **SDK/platform for building apps that remember their users** (you write code; it usually calls an LLM, cloud by default). Yggdrasil is **drop-in, local-first memory of _your own_ work for the agents you already code with.** Different job — pick by who you are.

> Also pairs well with [**autoresearch**](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) — an autonomous experiment loop (not a memory tool); Yggdrasil gives it long-term memory of what it already tried → [integration](./integrations/autoresearch/).

**TL;DR:** building an AI *product* that must remember its users at scale → **mem0**. You're the *developer* and want Claude Code / Codex to remember *your* decisions across projects, installed in one line, fully local → **Yggdrasil**.

## 🧰 Commands

Agents see six MCP tools: `ygg_health`, `ygg_bootstrap`, `ygg_search`, `ygg_recall`, `ygg_remember`, `ygg_materialize`. After `ygg install` they're auto-registered with Claude Code and Codex — just open a project and work.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does it send my code or memory to the cloud?</b></summary>

No. The engine, the database, and the optional models all run locally. No account, no telemetry. Your memory never leaves your machine.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it automatically remember everything?</b></summary>

No — by design. Retrieval is automatic; *writing* is deliberate (the agent calls `ygg_remember` for durable lessons). Auto-capturing everything pollutes memory, so we don't. A background model consolidates what's already saved (propose-only by default).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need a GPU or an API key?</b></summary>

No. The default is pure lexical search — zero dependencies, instant. Semantic search is opt-in and uses a *local* model via Ollama (no API key). The installer recommends a model that fits your hardware.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How heavy is it, and how many tokens does it cost?</b></summary>

Tiny. The engine is **~21 MB RAM, ~0% idle CPU, zero dependencies** (Python stdlib); disk is tens of KB per memory. Session start injects ~300 tokens of memory and each tool call returns a small snippet — all the heavy work (indexing, embeddings, consolidation) runs off-LLM on your machine.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How good is retrieval?</b></summary>

Measured by `eval/ygg_eval.py` (35 labelled cases, dev/holdout split), recall@1:

| Mode | recall@1 | paraphrase | crosslingual (EN→RU) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lexical (default) | 0.77 | 0.63 | 0.00 |
| dense · `all-minilm` (45 MB, EN) | 0.83 | 0.88 | 0.00 |
| dense · `paraphrase-multilingual` (~560 MB) | **0.94** | 0.88 | **0.80** |

`keyword` and `identifier` queries are 1.0 in every mode; with the multilingual model **recall@3 = 1.0** (every target in the top 3).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I edit or delete memories by hand?</b></summary>

Yes. Memories materialize to Markdown notes in an Obsidian vault — read, edit, or remove them like any file. The engine never hard-deletes; it archives (reversible).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is it production-ready?</b></summary>

It's an honest **alpha**: the happy path and the full governance loop are covered by passing gates (`scripts/run_gates.sh`). Not yet hardened for multi-user/production.
</details>

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- 🛰️ **Cross-surface sync** — connect from ChatGPT / Claude on the web and mobile; one memory across CLI, browser, and phone.
- 🔗 Relation graph (`SOLVES` / `SUPERSEDES` / `CONTRADICTS`) for richer reasoning.
- 🐧 Linux/Windows service installers (implemented; final on-device testing).

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Run `scripts/run_gates.sh` and `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` before submitting — all gates must stay green.
